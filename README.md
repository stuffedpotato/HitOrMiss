###### This project is an assignment that I completed for my Object-Oriented Programming in Java class at Langara.

## HitOrMiss

- I have created a simple ball game using JavaFX and Animation.
- I have utilized mouse events and tried my hand at some animation to make the game more visually fun!

1. In the ball game, if the user clicks on the ball, they win a hit and the speed of the ball increases with each hit.
2. If they miss a hit, the miss count increases.
3. If they have 5 misses, the game ends and the user must click the reset button to play the game again.
